# About the Rasternaut
Hi! Im Taylor, and this is a personal site where ive collected things I have worked on, written, or thought about in my educational, hobbyist, and professional capacities. This version of the site went up in 2024 after finishing my masters, but much of the content is older than that, just now collected in one place.

I intend to write about and showcase work revolving around game engines, with an emphasis on hardware accelerated Graphics. Occasionally touching on larger topics in software, such as design, open source, tools, and my experience navigating software engineering as a career.

All opinions expressed on this site are mine, and do not reflect my employers.

## Tech Stuff
This site is currently hosted using github pages, and is built with jekyll. I use a heavily modified version of [Abhinav Saxena's Moonwalk theme](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk). This stack was selected for its easy set up, free hosting, and the fact that it allows me enough control to feel like its "my" blog with out requiring me to deal with Wordpress, or go all in on the ever-shifting web development world.
